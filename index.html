        <b>Introduction</b>
        <p>Hi, I am Eswar, an ambitious and dedicated final-year B.Tech candidate specializing in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. I have a strong foundation in Java, SQL, and Data Structures and Algorithms, complemented by hands-on experience in developing a Library Management System during my Java internship. This internship allowed me to learn Java from scratch, covering key concepts such as exception handling and collections, and apply them to real-world scenarios.<br>
        I hold an NPTEL certification in Programming in Java and am currently exploring Python through topics like abstraction, sorting, searching, and games. My goal is to leverage my technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and passion for learning to contribute to innovative projects. I am actively seeking entry-level roles, internships, or collaborative opportunities that emphasize end-to-end project ownership and foster growth in software development.
